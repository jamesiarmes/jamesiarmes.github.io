Today I released my first plugin for [jQuery](http://jquery.com/),
[hasEvent](http://plugins.jquery.com/project/hasevent). This plugin takes a
selector and returns true if the element contains an action on that event.

Usage:
{% highlight javascript %}
$('#element_id').hasEvent('click');
{% endhighlight %}

This plugin has been tested with JQuery 1.2.6.
