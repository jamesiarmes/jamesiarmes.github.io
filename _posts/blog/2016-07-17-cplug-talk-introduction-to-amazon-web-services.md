![](/img/blog/2016/cplug-logo.png){: .image-left .post-image } This past Tuesday, I gave an introductory
presentation on [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com) at the monthly meetup for the
[Central Pennsylvania Linux User Group](http://www.cplug.net). The talk covered some of the services offered by AWS that
would be of interest for those launching application in the cloud, as well as a brief discussion on security. A demo was
given along with the presentation, but I was unable to record. The slides have been uploaded to SlideShare and included
below.

Next month I will be giving a more advanced talk where I will highlight one of the use cases we have for AWS at
[Acquia](http://www.acquia.com), and how we utilize CloudFormation for deploy it.
