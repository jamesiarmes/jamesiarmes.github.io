![I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.][nuke-site]{: .post-image }
It's been some time since I've written a post (August 25, 2016, to be exact). So
long in fact, that I've decided to start from ground zero. Much of the
information that was contained on the site is long outdated, and I was far less
experienced when it was written.

I always have high aspirations; thinking I'll post once a week, or at least once
a month. I have no such delusions this time around. While I'd like to post more
often, and I have been working on some cool stuff with [Code for America][cfa]
that I would love to share, I'm not going to but an undue pressure on myself.

If you're looking for something from the previous iteration of this site, all
pages have been [archived][archive] and the code has been [tagged].
