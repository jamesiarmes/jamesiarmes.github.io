After three years, I have decided to leave
[AllPlayers.com](https://www.allplayers.com). Over these last three years, I
have had the opportunity to work with many talented people and seen my career
grow in ways that I never expected. This has not been an easy decision but I
feel that the time has come for me to move on. I want to make it clear that this
is not a reflection of the current state of the company. AllPlayers.com is
continuing to do great things and I have the utmost confidence that they will
continue to succeed.

Starting September 15, 2014, I will begin my new position as Cloud Software
Engineer for [Acquia](http://www.acquia.com/). I look forward to all of the
challenges that await me and all of the wonderful things that I will be able to
contribute to. Although I will not be working directly with Drupal, I look
forward to being able to support Drupal in other ways by working for the largest
provider of Drupal hosting and services. I will be continuing to work remotely
from my home office in Millersburg, PA while traveling occasionally to Acquia's
home office in Burlington, MA.

To all my friends at AllPlayers.com, it has truly been a pleasure to work with
each and everyone of one. Keep up the good work, like I know you will. I will
miss all of you deeply.
