I have been doing a lot of web service development at work lately. I completed a
[FedEx](http://www.fedex.com) integration for
[WorkXpress](http://www.workxpress.com) and have been working on a new
integration with [Drupal](http://drupal.org). Each of these integrations have
involved using both SOAP servers and clients (the client being WorkXpress).

This has led me on a quest to learn more about web services. While I'm
experienced with SOAP and WSDL, I really don't know much about the underlying
architecture. I also know very little about other web service protocols (such as
REST and XML-RPC). I found a really good article at
<http://michaeldehaan.net/2008/07/17/xmlrpc-vs-rest-vs-soap-vs-all-your-rpc-options/>
which highlights the pros and cons of different protocols.

Having read all this, I'm still not sure what the current preference is.
Specifically with web developers, but I would like to hear from everyone. So,
what's your web service protocol of choice?
