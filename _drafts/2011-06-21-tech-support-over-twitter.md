title: Tech Support, Over Twitter?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com">Verizon Wireless</a> turned on their 4G LTE service in Harrisburg. Being the proud owner of an HTC Thunderbolt, one of only three 4G smart phones offered by Verizon, I was looking forward to trying it out when I got to the office. Imagine my disappointment when my phone would only connect to the 3G network. So I set out to find a solution to my problem.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found nothing on Google and was prepared to call tech support. It was still early in the morning so I was waiting until they would be opened when I saw a friend reference <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/vzwsupport">@VZWSupport</a> in a tweet. I had never thought about trying to get technical support over <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, but I figured I would give it a shot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sent a tweet to @VZWSupport and received a reply shortly. Several tweets later it was time for me to leave the office. My issue had yet to be resolved, but it was still one of the best experiences I have ever had with tech support. You can see the entire conversation below:</p>
