![](/assets/images/2016/cplug-logo.png){: .image-left .post-image } Earlier this
month, I gave a follow-up to
[last month's talk]({% post_url 2016-07-17-cplug-talk-introduction-to-amazon-web-services %})
on [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com) at the monthly meetup for the
[Central Pennsylvania Linux User Group](http://www.cplug.net). The talk covered
launching services using CloudFormation and
[moonshot](https://github.com/acquia/moonshot). A demo was given along with the
presentation, but I was unable to record. The slides have been uploaded to
SlideShare and included below.
