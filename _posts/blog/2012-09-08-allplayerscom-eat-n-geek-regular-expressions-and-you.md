Above is the presentation I gave for the August 8, 2012 AllPlayers.com Eat N'
Geek on regular expressions. The presentation gives a general introduction to
regular expressions and syntax before covering some more advanced concepts such
as lookarounds and conditions. A full write up by
[Allan Chappell](https://twitter.com/general_redneck) can be found on the
[AllPlayers Dev Blog](http://allplayers.github.com/blog/2012/08/13/regular-expressions-and-you/).
