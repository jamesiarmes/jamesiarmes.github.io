title: What's Your Web Service Protocol Of Choice?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been doing a lot of web service development at work lately.  I completed a <a href="http://www.fedex.com">FedEx</a> integration for <a href="http://www.workxpress.com">WorkXpress</a> and have been working on a new integration with <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>.  Each of these integrations have involved using both SOAP servers and clients (the client being WorkXpress).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has led me on a quest to learn more about web services.  While I'm experienced with SOAP and WSDL, I really don't know much about the underlying architecture.  I also know very little about other web service protocols (such as REST and XML-RPC).  I found a really good article at <a href="http://michaeldehaan.net/2008/07/17/xmlrpc-vs-rest-vs-soap-vs-all-your-rpc-options/">http://michaeldehaan.net/2008/07/17/xmlrpc-vs-rest-vs-soap-vs-all-your-rpc-options/</a> which highlights the pros and cons of different protocols.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having read all this, I'm still not sure what the current preference is.  Specifically with web developers, but I would like to hear from everyone.  So, what's your web service protocol of choice?
