<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I received a letter in the mail today from <a href="http://www.cambridgewhoswho.com">Cambridge Who's Who</a>.&nbsp; The letter stated that I had been &quot;appointed as a biographical candidate to represent Duncannon, PA in the 2009/2010 online <strong><em>Cambridge Who's Who Registry among Executives and Professionals</em></strong>.&quot;&nbsp; The letter goes on to say that I have been chosen based on my current position and that inclusion in the registry is free.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to complete my listing, It stated I could fill out a form online or send in an application that was provided with the letter.&nbsp; Needless to say, I was very skeptical from the start.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A quick Google for &quot;Cambridge Who's Who&quot; returned <span id="main" style="visibility: visible;">79,100,000</span> results.&nbsp; Third from the top was a great blog entry from <a href="http://accrispin.blogspot.com/">Writer Beware Blogs!</a> entitled &quot;<a href="http://accrispin.blogspot.com/2007/04/victoria-strauss-beware-whos-who.html">Beware Who's Who Schemes</a>&quot;.&nbsp; This post list several Who's Who scams including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>United Who's Who</li>
    <li>International Who's Who Historical Society</li>
    <li>American Who's Who Association</li>
    <li>Premier Who's Who</li>
    <li>Emerald Who's Who</li>
    <li>Madison Who's Who</li>
    <li>Global Register's Who's Who</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, Cambridge Who's Who.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While that was enough for me, I decided to do a little bit more research.&nbsp; The next place I went was <a href="http://www.ripoffreport.com/">Ripoff Report</a>.&nbsp; A search here returned <a href="http://www.ripoffreport.com/Search/cambridge-who_s-who.aspx">53 results</a>.&nbsp; And next was a search on the <a href="http://www.bbb.org/">Better Business Bureau</a>, which showed <a href="http://search.newyork.bbb.org/reports.aspx?pid=44&amp;page=1&amp;id=73212">464 complaints</a> in the last 36 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is just a reminder to always be skeptical.</p>
