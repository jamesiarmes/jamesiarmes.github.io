to Civic Tech in 2020. They are focused on making government services available

During High School, James studied Computer Information Systems at the Center for

for giving them the motivation needed to continue their education and do what
they love. After graduating form Avon Grove High School in 2003 and receiving a

developers and worked on Drupal and Drupal Commerce full-time, allowing them to
contribute back to the community on a regular basis.

Software Engineer for [Acquia][4]. As a Senior Engineer and Scrum Master on the
Cloud Data team, they helped to design and deliver a database and distributed
file system service used by Acquia Cloud to support customer sites.

After 13 years working for the private sector, James decided that they wanted to
use their skills and expertise to help real people over private organizations.
They joined the Civic Tech industry in 2020 as a Senior Infrastructure Engineer
for Nava PBC. As the logging technical lead for the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS), they provided a logging and monitoring framework for

ordered as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
