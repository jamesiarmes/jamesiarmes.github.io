![](/img/blog/2014/12/exchange-logo.png){: .image-left .post-image } The
first official
[release](https://github.com/jamesiarmes/php-ews/releases/tag/v0.1) of
[php-ews](https://github.com/jamesiarmes/php-ews) has been created. This release
includes support for Microsoft Exchange Server versions 2007 through 2010 SP3.
Support for 2013 will be included in a future release. This release will not be
continually supported, as resources will be devoted towards moving the library
in a direction that makes it easier to use and implements standards such as
[PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) and features such as composer
support.
