title: The Browser Is Mightier Than The Rich Text Area

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Firefox 3 Beta 5 was released, there has been some problems with our Rich Text Areas in WorkXpress.  The control renders but remains gray; there is no way for users to enter text.  This problem persist in Firefox 3 Release Candidate 1.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To resolve this issue, I have been tasked with updating our TinyMCE code from 2.0.2 to 3.0.7.  This is no easy task, as the API for TinyMCE 3 is very different than the API for version 2.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently in the process of converting all of our custom plugins to function with the new version.  I will be sure to update once I complete this task.
