<p><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/blog/2014/12/php-ews-01-released/exchange-logo.png" style="width: 300px; height: 288px; float: left;">The first offical <a href="https://github.com/jamesiarmes/php-ews/releases/tag/v0.1">release</a> of <a href="https://github.com/jamesiarmes/php-ews">php-ews</a> has been created. This release includes support for Microsoft Exchange Server versions 2007 through 2010 SP3. Support for 2013 will be included in a future release. This release will not be continually support, as resources will be devoted towards moving the library in a direction that makes it easier to use and implements standards such as <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/">PSR-4</a> and features such as composer support.</p>
