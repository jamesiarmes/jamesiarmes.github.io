I received a letter in the mail today from
[Cambridge Who's Who](http://www.cambridgewhoswho.com).
The letter stated that I had been "appointed as a biographical candidate to
represent Duncannon, PA in the 2009/2010 online **_Cambridge Who's Who Registry
among Executives and Professionals_**." The letter goes on to say that I have
been chosen based on my current position and that inclusion in the registry is
free. In order to complete my listing, It stated I could fill out a form online
or send in an application that was provided with the letter. Needless to say, I
was very skeptical from the start.

A quick Google for "Cambridge Who's Who" returned 79,100,000 results. Third from
the top was a great blog entry from
[Writer Beware Blogs!](http://accrispin.blogspot.com/) entitled
"[Beware Who's Who Schemes](http://accrispin.blogspot.com/2007/04/victoria-strauss-beware-whos-who.html)".
This post list several Who's Who scams including:

* United Who's Who
* International Who's Who Historical Society
* American Who's Who Association
* Premier Who's Who
* Emerald Who's Who
* Madison Who's Who
* Global Register's Who's Who

And of course, Cambridge Who's Who.

While that was enough for me, I decided to do a little bit more research. The
next place I went was [Ripoff Report](http://www.ripoffreport.com/). A search
here returned
[53 results](http://www.ripoffreport.com/Search/cambridge-who_s-who.aspx).
And next was a search on the [Better Business Bureau](http://www.bbb.org/),
which showed
[464 complaints](http://search.newyork.bbb.org/reports.aspx?pid=44&amp;page=1&amp;id=73212)
in the last 36 months.

This is just a reminder to always be skeptical.
