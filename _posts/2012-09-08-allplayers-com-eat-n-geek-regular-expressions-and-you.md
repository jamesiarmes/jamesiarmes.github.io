<p>Above is the presentation I gave for the August 8, 2012 AllPlayers.com Eat N' Geek on regular expressions. The presentation gives a general introduction to regular expressions and syntax before covering some more advanced concepts such as lookarounds and conditions. A full write up by&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/general_redneck">Allan Chappell</a> can be found on the AllPlayers.com dev blog at&nbsp;<a href="http://allplayers.github.com/blog/2012/08/13/regular-expressions-and-you/">http://allplayers.github.com/blog/2012/08/13/regular-expressions-and-you/</a>.</p>
